A Space Invaders based game created to gain experience with c++ and the sfml library.
The game makes use of many of sfml's audio and graphics features.
The game contains many commonalities in game programming including: 

    Different scenes (Menu, HighScore, Gameplay) each with there own functionality
    
    Reliance on object oriented programming to improve maintainability
    
    Collision detection
    
    Animations (explosion when enemy is destroyed)
    
    Sprites

    Sound Effects (upon bullets firing and explosions)
    User input from keyboard and mouse

Fun Fact, I drew the health bar and star sprites in an online drawing software myself.
